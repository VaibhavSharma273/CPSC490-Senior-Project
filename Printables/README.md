This directory contains the STL files for the three 3D printed components of this smart glass. In the fabrication of the smart glasses frame, I employed 3D printing technology to create three distinct components: the left ear piece, the right ear piece, and the front piece. I found the 3D models online and modified their scale a little on Tinkercad. I used an Ender 3 Printer and PLA filament. I conducted multiple printing iterations, with different settings. The final settings that I went with were:
  

| Setting               | Value        |
| ----------------------|:------------:|
| Printing Temperature  | 215 C    |
| Bed Temperature       | 70 C     |
| Speed                 | 60 mm/s  | 
| Layer Height          | 0.12 mm  | 
| Infill                | 30 %     |
